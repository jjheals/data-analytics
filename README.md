# data-analytics
A repo of data analytics tools that I've created.

I created these tools primarily for practice for the Reinvent-The-Wheel Hackathon (Nov. 2022), details about the Hackathon can be found here https://reinvent-the-wheel.com/. I participated in this challenge with some friends in November, 2022 and created these tools so that we could learn about matplotlib and data analysis in python. 

The Graph class is pretty basic and doesn't provide much flexibility, but changing the parameters is simple (simply add to the dict and add to the respective format method) so if ever needed the user can just copy the code and add their own parameters. The main goal was to provide myself with more knowledge of matplotlib and a basic framework to create simple graphs in the future. 

'stats_functions.py' contains standalone functions that can be used to perform data/statistical analysis.
